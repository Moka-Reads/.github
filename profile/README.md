# MoKa Reads

The plan of MoKa Reads is to serve as a comprehensive platform that aims to inform, conduct research, and generate open educational content in the field of programming. Our primary objective is to generate a diverse range of research papers, educational resources, and courses that enable institutions to adopt and adapt these materials. By doing so, we aim to promote sustainability, foster increased choice in learning, and create a sense of liberation in an environment often constrained by copyright restrictions.

In addition to the aforementioned goals, MoKa Reads also seeks to foster collaboration and community engagement among learners, educators, and industry professionals. Through interactive forums, workshops, and networking opportunities, we aim to facilitate knowledge sharing and create a vibrant ecosystem that encourages continuous growth and innovation. Furthermore, we aim to provide a framework for these educational contents to be freely available, with the exception of publications that will be sold under affordable pricing.

The name MoKa Reads is derived from the popular espresso-based drink Mocha, symbolizing the passion and addiction shared by programmers worldwide - coffee!
